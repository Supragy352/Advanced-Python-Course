### Day 4: Advanced IDE Features and Debugging Techniques

**Hour 1: Lecture and Concept Introduction**

-   **Advanced Features of IDEs**
    -   Introduction to advanced features across popular IDEs like VSCode, PyCharm, and Sublime Text.
    -   Focus on features that enhance productivity: code snippets, project management, version control integration, and multi-file navigation.
-   **Introduction to Debugging in Python**
    -   Overview of debugging: what it is, why it's important, and common tools used in Python development.
    -   Discuss the significance of breakpoints, watch windows, and step-through execution.

**Hour 2: Hands-On Coding**

-   **Setting Up Debugging Tools**
    -   Configure and demonstrate debugging tools in Sublime Text using packages like **Sublime Debugger**.
    -   Explore similar setups in VSCode and PyCharm to give students a comparison of debugging capabilities across different environments.
-   **Utilizing Advanced IDE Features**
    -   Demonstrate the use of code snippets and auto-completion features to speed up coding.
    -   Show how to manage large projects with multiple files using the project management tools available in Sublime Text.

**Hour 3: Practice and Exercises**

-   **Debugging Session**
    -   Conduct a live debugging session where students will identify and fix errors in a pre-written faulty Python script.
    -   Encourage students to use breakpoints and the integrated terminal to step through code and watch variable changes.
-   **Exploration of IDE Features**
    -   Exercises focused on utilizing advanced IDE features: setting up custom environments, using git integration for version control, and navigating through large codebases.

**Hour 4: Q&A and Discussion**

-   **Open Q&A Session**
    -   Address specific questions students have about debugging practices and IDE features.
    -   Discuss any issues encountered during the hands-on session.
-   **Best Practices Discussion**
    -   Share tips on best practices for using IDEs effectively in Python development.
    -   Discuss strategies to customize the development environment to best fit individual needs and projects.
