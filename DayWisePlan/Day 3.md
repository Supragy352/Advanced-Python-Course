### Day 3: Configuring Sublime Text as a Full Python IDE

**Hour 1: Lecture and Concept Introduction**

-   **Introduction to Sublime Text as an IDE**
    -   Discussion on the evolution of text editors to IDEs.
    -   Benefits of using Sublime Text for Python development: speed, customizability, and lightweight design.
-   **Key Components of an IDE**
    -   Overview of essential IDE features: syntax highlighting, code completion, error linting, and file management.

**Hour 2: Hands-On Coding**

-   **Installing Sublime Text and Package Control**
    -   Guide students through the installation of Sublime Text.
    -   Install Package Control, which facilitates the installation of other plugins and packages​ ([Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/how-to-configure-sublime-text-4-for-python-development/))​.
-   **Setting Up Essential Packages**
    -   Install and configure essential packages:
        -   **Anaconda** for linting and autocompletion​ ([Python Tutorials – Real Python](https://realpython.com/setting-up-sublime-text-3-for-full-stack-python-development/))​.
        -   **Terminus** to integrate a terminal within Sublime Text​ ([Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/how-to-configure-sublime-text-4-for-python-development/))​.
        -   **LSP-pylsp** for advanced language features like go-to definition and in-line documentation​ ([Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/how-to-configure-sublime-text-4-for-python-development/))​.

**Hour 3: Practice and Exercises**

-   **Customizing Sublime Text**
    -   Students will apply custom settings to optimize Sublime Text for Python development, focusing on preferences like `translate_tabs_to_spaces` to use spaces instead of tabs​ ([UW PCE Python Cert](https://uwpce-pythoncert.github.io/PythonCertDevel/supplemental/dev_environment/sublime_as_ide.html))​.
    -   Configure a build system in Sublime Text to run Python scripts directly from the editor​ ([Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/blog/how-to-configure-sublime-text-4-for-python-development/))​.
-   **Exploring Advanced Features**
    -   Utilize the installed packages to improve coding efficiency: navigate through code, use snippets, and employ the integrated terminal to execute Python scripts.

**Hour 4: Q&A and Discussion**

-   **Open Q&A Session**
    -   Resolve any issues students encountered during the setup and customization process.
    -   Answer questions regarding the use and customization of Sublime Text.
